# Iraq Conflict Data Analysis
This github repository is an exploration of conflict events in Iraq in 2019, as well as an exploration of visualization and spatial analysis techniques including hexbin heatmaps, DBSCAN clustering of geographic data, and categorical filtering of geographic data.

## Exploratory Analysis
In the 'Iraq Conflict Data Exploratory Analysis', you will find some basic visualizations as well as a simple DBSCAN clustering of events, designed to help better understand the data.
