# Iraq Conflict Data Analysis
This github repository is an exploration of conflict events in Iraq in 2019, as well as an exploration of visualization and spatial analysis techniques including hexbin heatmaps, DBSCAN clustering of geographic data, and categorical filtering of geographic data.

## Exploratory Analysis
In the 'Iraq Conflict Data Exploratory Analysis', you will find some basic visualizations as well as a simple DBSCAN clustering of events, designed to help better understand the data. 

## Interactive Map Visualizations
'Make Maps With Bokeh' notebook uses the 2019 Iraq conflict data as a means of experimenting and teaching the use of Bokeh to create interactive map products for dashboards. An accompanying Medium article is forthcoming. 

## The Data:
The data is from the Armed Conflict Location Event Database (ACLED), which can be found at acleddata.com.
